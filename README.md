# Expo CLI Build Failure: Incompatibility with Target Environment

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Expo projects:  failure due to incompatibility between the app's requirements (specified in `app.json` or `expo.json`) and the target device or simulator.  The error messages are often unhelpful, making diagnosis difficult.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file showcases an example project that might trigger this error. It's important to note that the specific cause will vary depending on your project configuration.  The core problem is a mismatch between the app's specified requirements and the capabilities of the execution environment.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a possible solution. This will depend on the specific error.  It demonstrates how to: 
1. Check your `app.json` (or `expo.json`) for minimum platform versions and ensure compatibility.
2. Verify your device or simulator meets the requirements.
3. Carefully review your build configurations for any conflicting settings or dependencies.
4. Ensure all project dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with the selected platform.
