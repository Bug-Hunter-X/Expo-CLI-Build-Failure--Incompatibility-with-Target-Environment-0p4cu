In `app.json` or `expo.json`, ensure that the `minSdkVersion` (for Android) and `ios.supportsTablet` (for iOS)  are set correctly and compatible with your testing environments.  If you are targeting older devices, increase the minimum version to match your testing environment. 
Additionally, check for incorrect configuration of dependencies or other settings that might conflict with the specific device or simulator you are using. A thorough examination of the Expo CLI's logs might reveal the cause. Always consult the Expo documentation for platform-specific requirements.
