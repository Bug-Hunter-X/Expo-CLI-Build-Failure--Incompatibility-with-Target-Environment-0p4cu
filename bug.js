This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and you attempt to run your app on a device or simulator that doesn't meet the minimum requirements specified in your app's `app.json` or `expo.json` file.  For instance, your app might require a minimum iOS version that's higher than the device's iOS version.  This can also happen if you have incorrectly configured build options or dependencies that conflict with the target environment.
